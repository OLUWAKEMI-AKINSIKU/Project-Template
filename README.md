# Project-Template

I wrote a bash script to automatically create a consistent folder and file layout for my machine learning projects. which saved time and help keep my project organised. I configured the script so it ask for a project name then generated files like 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and python files for different steps such as data cleaning and model training.
